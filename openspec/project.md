## Project Conventions

### Code Style
## Database Rules
* Database: **PostgreSQL**
* ORM: **PrismaORM**
* Migrations: **Prisma ORM migrations module**
* Always run `npx prisma migrate dev --name={migration_name}"` from the proper env context to generate new migrations, even for empty ones.
* Never create blank migrations manually; edit the autogenerated one if needed.
* Each migration must ensure no data loss. In production, rename existing tables with `_bkp_{timestamp}` before destructive changes and migrate data forward.
* During local development, destructive schema changes are acceptable if migrations remain idempotent.

---

## Backend Rules
* Backend: **NestJS** API (REST)
* Abide by SOLID principles. No library coupling that prevents replacing ORM or framework.
* Controllers handle HTTP and validation only; no business logic.
* Services implement stateless business logic.
* Repositories abstract database access.
* Schemas define request/response DTOs.
* Unit tests mandatory under `/tests` using **pytest**.
* Tests must isolate logic (mock DB/network).
* Files ends with `.spec.ts` and live under `/tests/unit` inside the app folder.
* Use HTTP-only, Secure cookies for communication; include CSRF tokens for mutating requests.
* Background jobs must use **Celery + SQS**.
* Configuration strictly via environment variables (.env files).

---

## Frontend Rules
* Frontend: **React + NextJS** avoid using the NextJS API capabilities, just keep it for proxy concerns, but try to avoid it
* Use **TanStack Query** for data fetching and caching.
* Avoid `useEffect` unless absolutely necessary, do not handle app state inside it.
* Use **Zustand** for global state management.
* Use **TailwindCSS** for styling (no inline styles).
* Follow SOLID and avoid React anti-patterns.
* Unit tests mandatory using **react-testing-library**.
* Tests live under `/test` folder inside the client app mirroring the folder structure.
